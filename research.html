<h2>1.1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous metal that has been known and utilized for centuries, primarily for its 
role in galvanizing steel to prevent corrosion, and in the production of alloys such as brass. As the 
fourth most widely consumed metal after iron, aluminum, and copper, zinc plays an essential role in 
modern industrial applications, construction, transportation, and even biological processes. 
One of the most significant sources of zinc is sphalerite (ZnS), a naturally occurring mineral that 
contains a high percentage of zinc. Sphalerite, often referred to as zinc blende, is typically found in 
association with minerals such as galena (PbS), pyrite (FeS₂), and other sulfide minerals. The mineral 
appears in a variety of colors depending on its iron content but is usually brown to black with a 
resinous luster. 
The extraction of zinc from sphalerite has been a subject of technological development for over a 
century. It involves complex processes that convert the insoluble and chemically stable zinc sulfide 
into pure metallic zinc or zinc compounds. The major extraction techniques include pyrometallurgical 
and hydrometallurgical processes, both requiring careful control of temperature, pressure, and 
chemical reactions to achieve efficient recovery of the metal. 

</p>

<h2>1.3 IMPORTANCE OF ZINC EXTRACTION</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Galvanization: Protecting steel and iron from corrosion. </li>
    <li>Alloy Production: Forming alloys like brass and nickel silver. </li>
    <li>Chemical Industry: Used in the production of paints, rubber, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. </li>
    <li>Agriculture: Essential micronutrient in fertilizers. </li>

</ul>


<ul>
    <h2>Two primary routes dominate the extraction of zinc from sphalerite:</h2>
    <li> Pyrometallurgical Route
 : This involves roasting the sphalerite ore to convert zinc sulfide into zinc 
oxide, which is then reduced to metallic zinc via smelting. The process emits sulfur dioxide gas, which 
must be managed to prevent environmental pollution. </li>
    <li>Hydrometallurgical Route
 : 
This process typically involves roasting followed by leaching with 
sulfuric acid to dissolve the zinc oxide, leaving behind insoluble impurities. The zinc is subsequently 
recovered through processes like electrolysis or precipitation. 
Each method has its advantages and limitations, particularly concerning energy consumption, 
environmental impact, and the quality of the final product.</li>
</ul>


<h2>1.4 CHALLENGES IN ZINC EXTRACTION</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Complexity of Ore Bodies: Sphalerite often coexists with other minerals requiring separation 
and purification</li>
    <li> Environmental Concerns: Roasting releases sulfur dioxide, a significant pollutant 
contributing to acid rainEnvironmental concerns</li>
    <li>Energy Consumption: Both pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes are energy
intensive. </li>
    <li> Economic Factors: Fluctuations in the market price of zinc affect the viability of certain 
extraction methods.</li>

<div class="chapter-title">CHAPTER TWO — LITERATURE REVIEW</div>

<h2>2.1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The extraction of zinc from its primary ore, sphalerite (ZnS), has been extensively studied over the 
decades due to the metal’s vital industrial applications. This chapter explores existing research on the 
geological occurrence of sphalerite, the mineralogical characteristics of the ore, traditional and modern 
extraction methods, advancements in hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical techniques, and factors 
affecting extraction efficiency. It also highlights recent innovations aimed at improving zinc recovery 
and reducing environmental impact. </p>

<h2>2.2 OVERVIEW OF SPHALERITE ORE</h2>
<p>Sphalerite, chemically zinc sulfide (ZnS), is the most important source of zinc. It is usually found 
associated with other sulfide minerals such as galena (PbS) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂) in hydrothermal 
veins and sedimentary exhalative deposits. The purity of sphalerite varies depending on the presence of 
iron impurities, which can significantly affect its physical and chemical properties. Studies have shown 
that the iron content in sphalerite can range from trace amounts up to 25% (Frost et al., 2011). 
The structural composition of sphalerite is typically a cubic crystal system. The presence of impurities 
such as cadmium, manganese, and indium can alter the mineral’s behavior during extraction processes, 
influencing both roasting and leaching efficiency (Pavlović et al., 2015).</p>

<h2>2.3 TRADITIONAL METHODS OF ZINC EXTRACTION</h2>

<h3>2.3.1 Pyrometallurgical Methods</h3>
<p>In the pyrometallurgical route, sphalerite is first subjected to roasting, converting ZnS to zinc oxide 
(ZnO) by reaction with oxygen at temperatures around 900–1000°C: 
2ZnS + 3O2 → 2ZnO + 2SO2 
The produced ZnO is then reduced using carbon or carbon monoxide to obtain metallic zinc: 
7 
ZnO + C → Zn + CO 
However, the high energy requirements and generation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) emissions pose 
significant environmental concerns (Habashi, 1997). </p>

<h3>2.3.2 Hydrometallurgical Methods</h3>
<p>The hydrometallurgical process has gained prominence due to its lower environmental impact. In this 
method, roasted zinc oxide is leached with sulfuric acid to produce zinc sulfate solution: 
ZnO + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2O 
Subsequent purification steps remove iron, cadmium, and copper before the purified solution 
undergoes electrowinning, where metallic zinc is deposited at the cathode.</p>

<h2>2.4 
MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Direct leaching:Direct leaching of sphalerite using oxidative agents such as ferric chloride (FeCl₃) or oxygen under 
acidic conditions has been investigated to avoid the costly roasting stage: 
ZnS + 2Fe3+ → Zn2+ + 2Fe2+ + S 
Despite the attractiveness of this method, challenges remain, particularly the slow kinetics of the 
leaching reactions and elemental sulfur passivation on mineral surfaces (Sandström and Petersson, 
1997). </li>
    <li>Bioleaching: Bioleaching uses microorganisms like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to oxidize sulfide minerals, 
facilitating zinc extraction. These bacteria oxidize Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ and produce sulfuric acid, enhancing the 
dissolution of sphalerite. 
Bioleaching is energy-efficient and environmentally friendly but slower compared to chemical 
leaching methods. Temperature, pH, and nutrient availability are critical parameters influencing 
microbial activity and, hence, leaching rates (Rawlings et al., 2003).</li>
    <li>Pressure leaching involves treating sphalerite concentrates at elevated temperatures (140–200°C) and 
pressures in the presence of oxygen or ferric ions. This method achieves high zinc recovery rates and 
minimizes sulfur passivation by forming elemental sulfur as a fine dispersion (Dutrizac, 1983). </li>
</ul>

<h2>2.5 FACTORS AFFECTING EXTRACTION</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ore Mineralogy: The presence of iron and other metals can hinder or enhance leaching and 
roasting processes. </li>
    <li> Particle Size: Finer particles improve leaching kinetics due to a higher surface area but may 
also complicate solid-liquid separation steps.</li>
    <li>Temperature and Pressure: Higher temperatures and pressures generally improve leaching 
rates but increase operational costs. </li>
    <li>Oxidant Type and Concentration: The choice and availability of oxidants like ferric ions or 
oxygen critically affect the direct leaching processes. </li>
</ul>

<h2>2.6 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p>Traditional zinc extraction methods generate significant environmental concerns, notably the emission 
of sulfur dioxide gas during roasting and large volumes of acidic effluent during hydrometallurgical 
processing. Recent studies emphasize integrating gas scrubbing systems, wastewater treatment plants, 
and closed-loop recycling processes to minimize ecological footprints (Ndlovu and Beukes, 2019). 
Furthermore, the valorization of leaching residues and recovery of by-products like germanium and 
indium are increasingly viewed as pathways toward sustainable extraction practices. </p>

<div class="chapter-title">CHAPTER FOUR — RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</div>

<h2>4.1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This chapter presents the results obtained from the experimental investigation into the extraction of 
zinc from sphalerite ore, followed by a detailed discussion of these results. The performance of 
different extraction methods—pyrometallurgical roasting followed by acid leaching, and direct 
oxidative leaching—was analyzed in terms of zinc recovery rates, efficiency, and process behavior. 
Factors influencing the extraction efficiency, such as temperature, leaching time, acid concentration, 
and oxidant presence, are discussed. </p>

<h2>4.2 ORE CHARACTERIZATION</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITION (XRD ANALYSIS) 
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) results confirmed that the major mineral phase present in the ore sample was 
sphalerite (ZnS), with minor phases of galena (PbS) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂). Some quartz (SiO₂) 
was also detected as gangue material. </li>
    <li>
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION (XRF ANALYSIS) 
 The chemical analysis showed: <br>
 Zinc (Zn) content: 56.3% <br>
 Iron (Fe) content: 8.5% <br>
 Lead (Pb) content: 3.2% <br>
 Sulfur (S) content: 30.7% <br>
 Other trace elements (Cd, Cu, SiO₂)<br> 
The relatively high iron content suggested the sphalerite was iron-bearing, influencing its roasting and 
leaching behavior. </li>
</ul>

<h2>4.3 ROASTING RESULTS</h2>
<p>The roasting experiments indicated that: 
At 850°C, partial oxidation of sphalerite occurred, with significant residual sulfur detected. 
At 900°C, over 90% of the ZnS was converted to ZnO. 
At 950–1000°C, nearly complete conversion (>95%) was achieved. 
XRD analysis of roasted samples confirmed ZnO as the dominant phase with minor residual ZnS at 
lower temperatures.</p>
<h2>
WEIGHT LOSS DURING ROASTING</h2>
<p>Weight loss corresponded with the release of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) gas: 
Average weight loss at 900°C was 28–30%, consistent with theoretical loss from ZnS to ZnO 
conversion. </p>

<h2>Discussion: </h2>
<p>Roasting at 900–950°C was found optimal, providing a balance between efficient sulfur removal and 
avoiding excessive sintering of particles, which could impede leaching. </p>

<h2>4.4 LEACHING RESULTS</h2>
<p>
ACID LEACHING OF ROASTED ORE <br>
Zinc Recovery: Leaching roasted samples at 60–80°C with 1M sulfuric acid resulted in zinc 
recoveries between 85% and 92%. <br>
Effect of Temperature: Higher leaching temperatures favored faster dissolution rates. <br>
Effect of Leaching Time: Maximum zinc recovery was achieved after 90 minutes of leaching. <br>
Discussion: <br>
The high recovery confirmed that roasting effectively transformed ZnS to ZnO, which readily 
dissolved in sulfuric acid. Incomplete roasting (at 850°C) led to lower zinc extraction due to residual 
unreacted ZnS. </p>

<h2>
COMPARISON OF EXTRACTION METHODS </h2>
<p>Roasting followed by acid leaching remains the industry-standard for high recovery. However, direct 
oxidative leaching is attractive for low-grade ores and for operations prioritizing environmental 
sustainability, especially if combined with bioleaching enhancements. </p>

<h2>
FACTORS AFFECTING EXTRACTION EFFICIENCY </h2>
<p> Roasting Temperature: Complete conversion of ZnS to ZnO improved leaching.  <br>
 Acid Concentration: Sufficient sulfuric acid concentration ensured maximum Zn dissolution.  <br>
 Oxidant Strength: Ferric chloride concentration dictated leaching rates in direct methods.  <br>
 Leaching Time and Temperature: Optimized conditions minimized energy input while  
maximizing recovery.  <br>
 Particle Size: Finer particles facilitated faster leaching but complicated solid-liquid separation. .</p>


<h2>
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS </h2>
<p>Roasting processes pose environmental challenges due to sulfur dioxide emissions, necessitating gas 
scrubbing technologies. <br>
Direct leaching processes, though slower, potentially offer more environmentally benign alternatives.<br> 
Future improvements could involve integrating biooxidation pre-treatments to enhance direct leaching 
efficiency and reduce operational costs.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY  </h4>
<p> chapter presented and discussed the results of the zinc extraction experiments. Roasting followed 
by acid leaching yielded the highest zinc recovery, but at the cost of higher energy use and 
environmental concerns. Direct oxidative leaching offered a lower-cost, more environmentally friendly 
route but with slightly reduced recovery rates. Optimal process parameters were identified for 
maximizing zinc recovery while balancing operational and environmental factors..</p>

<h2>5.1 CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The study on the extraction of zinc from sphalerite ore provided valuable insights into the effectiveness 
of different extraction methods and the factors influencing process efficiency. 
The characterization of the ore revealed that sphalerite (ZnS) was the major mineral phase, 
accompanied by minor impurities such as galena (PbS) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂). Chemical analysis 
indicated a high zinc content of approximately 56%, making the ore a good candidate for zinc 
extraction. <br>
In the roasting stage, it was observed that temperatures between 900°C and 950°C effectively 
converted sphalerite to zinc oxide (ZnO), facilitating subsequent acid leaching. Roasting also led to the 
removal of sulfur through the generation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) gas, although environmental 
considerations must be addressed due to emissions. <br>
The acid leaching of roasted ore achieved zinc recoveries between 85% and 92%, confirming that 
roasting significantly enhanced leachability. Higher leaching temperatures and optimal acid 
concentrations contributed positively to dissolution rates. <br> 
Direct oxidative leaching of unroasted sphalerite using ferric chloride solutions showed that zinc could 
also be extracted without prior roasting, achieving recoveries of 70–80%. However, challenges such as 
elemental sulfur formation and ferric ion precipitation limited the overall effectiveness of this route.<br> 
The electrowinning of zinc from the leachate produced high-purity zinc (approximately 99.5%), 
demonstrating that the downstream recovery processes were effective..</p>
<h2> SUMMARY:</h2>
<p>  Roasting + Acid Leaching method proved more efficient in terms of zinc recovery but required 
significant energy input and produced environmentally hazardous gases. 
Direct Oxidative Leaching was more environmentally friendly but achieved slightly lower recovery 
rates. <br> Thus, the choice of extraction method should depend on the ore quality, environmental regulations, 
energy costs, and project-specific economic considerations.  </p>
<h2>5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Roasting Optimization: In industrial applications, roasting temperature should be controlled between 
900°C and 950°C to maximize ZnO formation while minimizing energy costs and particle sintering. 
Leaching Conditions: In acid leaching, maintaining the temperature at 70–80°C and using an acid 
concentration of approximately 1M sulfuric acid yields optimum results.</li>
    <li>Emission Management: Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) emissions during roasting should be captured using gas 
scrubbers or converted into sulfuric acid in an acid plant to mitigate environmental pollution. 
Waste Handling: Residual leachates and solid wastes should be properly neutralized and managed to 
prevent soil and water contamination.</li>
    <li>Focus on Direct Leaching: For ores with lower zinc content or in regions with stringent environmental 
laws, direct oxidative leaching processes should be further investigated and improved, possibly by 
integrating bioleaching techniques or sulfur-removal strategies. <br>
Use of Alternative Oxidants: Other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) or manganese dioxide 
(MnO₂) could be explored to enhance leaching performance without introducing heavy metals like iron 
into the system</li>
</ul>

<h2>
ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS </h2>
<p>Cost-Benefit Analysis: Future work should include a detailed economic assessment comparing roasting 
plus leaching versus direct leaching, considering factors like energy costs, environmental penalties, 
and reagent expenses.<br> Small-Scale Applications: In areas with limited access to energy resources, direct leaching methods 
should be prioritized to minimize infrastructure and operational costs.   </p>
<h2>   
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS</h2>
<p> Bioleaching: Research into bacterial leaching of sphalerite could offer an even more environmentally 
sustainable method of zinc extraction. <br>
Process Integration: Hybrid processes combining mild roasting and oxidative leaching could be 
developed to balance efficiency, environmental impact, and costs. <br>
Ore Blending: Investigating the blending of high-grade and low-grade ores might help optimize 
extraction parameters and increase overall plant feed flexibility.  </p>

<h2> 
SUMMARY </h2>
<p>The extraction of zinc from sphalerite is a complex but manageable process that can be highly efficient 
if well-optimized. This study demonstrated that while traditional roasting and acid leaching methods 
deliver higher zinc recoveries, alternative methods like direct oxidative leaching present promising 
environmentally friendly options. Future improvements should focus on environmental sustainability, 
cost reduction, and technological innovation to ensure that zinc extraction from sphalerite remains 
economically viable and environmentally responsible.
